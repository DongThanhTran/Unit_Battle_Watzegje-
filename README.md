_A Codam Coding College unit battle session_

## Kata Description
Write a program that can calculate the score of a bowlingame. 
![Frames](media/frames.png)

The game consists of 10 frames.  In each frame the player has
two opportunities to knock down 10 pins.  The score for the frame is the total
number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.

A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries.  The bonus for
that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll.  So in frame 3
above, the score is 10 (the total number knocked down) plus a bonus of 5 (the
number of pins knocked down on the next roll.)

A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try.  The bonus
for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled.

In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the extra
balls to complete the frame.  However no more than three balls can be rolled in
tenth frame.

There can be one or two rolls in a Frame. If the first roll makes all the pins fall, then there is no second roll. There is a Mark for each Frame that depends on the number of rolls and the total pins.

## Examples
```console
./bowling_game 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; @echo All Gutter Balls
0
All Gutter Balls
```
```console
./bowling_game 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10; @echo Perfect Game
300
Perfect Game
```
```console
./bowling_game 9 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 9; @echo All Spares
190
All Spares
```
```console
./bowling_game 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 0; @echo Nothing Special
90
Nothing Special
```
```console
./bowling_game 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 9 1; @echo Almost Perfect
289
Almost Perfect
```
Invalid input should display Error
```console
./bowling_game a 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
Error
```
```console
./bowling_game -1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
Error
```
```console
./bowling_game 11 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
Error
```
## Win Conditions
The code has to take in 0-21 valid bowling scores and calculate the apropiate scores

The code will be graded on a mix of the amount of % of coverage of your unit test, the amount of unit tests, the speed you completed the project and the cleanliness of your code base

The projects with the best scores will be graded by nicolas and a winner will be picked

## Rules
Abide the rules of TDD at all times:

You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.

You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to failâ€“ and not compiling is failing. 

You are not allowed to write more production code that is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.

You will work in a team of 2-4 people in which half of the team will write the FAILING UNIT TESTS and the other half of the team will write PASSING CODE for those tests. Good communication will be of utmost importance!

## Setup
Run the following command before starting your project or add these commands to your .zsh or .bashrc
```console
export LIBRARY_PATH=/sgoinfre/criterion_test/.brew/lib:${LIBRARY_PATH}
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/sgoinfre/criterion_test/.brew/include:${C_INCLUDE_PATH}
```
Alternatively run the bash script inside the folder
```console
bash environment.sh
```
## Usage
Compile the project
```console
make
```
Recompile the project
```console
make re
```
Run all of the tests.
```console
make tests_run
```
Recompile your tests.
```console
make re_tests
```
Find leaks in your program
```console
make fsan
```
Compile a debuggable executable
```console
make debug
```
Debug your program
```console
lldb bowling_game
b main
r
gui
```
